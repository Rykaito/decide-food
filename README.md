# Utica Eats
This is the front-end for a personal project intended to help choose where to get food in my hometown. All it consists of is a simple PostgreSQL database and functionality for selecting restaurants and randomly choosing one from that selection. It also includes basic add and remove features so that the list can be updated easily in the future.

Please give it a few moments after opening to retrieve the list from the back-end.
